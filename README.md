# Signals Generator & Operator (MATLAB)

A modular and fully functional MATLAB-based Signals Generator and Operator developed as part of the Signals and Systems course (Mechatronics & Robotics Engineering Program). The project provides a flexible environment for generating, manipulating, and analyzing different signal types through an interactive workflow.

This repository contains the implementation of the second part of the project report, which focuses on the design and development of a configurable signal generation and transformation framework.

# Overview

The Signals Generator & Operator is designed to bridge theoretical signal processing concepts with practical implementation. The program allows users to define signal parameters, generate various signal types, apply signal operations, and visualize results in a structured and extensible architecture.

# Key Features
Signal Generation

DC (constant) signals

Ramp (linear) signals

Polynomial signals with configurable order and coefficients

Exponential signals (growth/decay)

Sinusoidal signals (sine/cosine with amplitude, phase, frequency, and DC offset)

Gaussian pulse generation

Sawtooth waveform generation

Random signal generation for testing and experimentation

# Time Configuration

User-defined start and end time

Adjustable sampling frequency

Automatic validation and error handling

Sampling quality checks (including Nyquist considerations)

# Piecewise Signal Construction

Combine multiple signal types using configurable breakpoints

Build complex signals from multiple segments

# Signal Operations

Amplitude scaling

Time shifting

Time reversal

Time expansion and compression

Noise addition

Signal smoothing (moving average)

# Architecture & Design

Modular function-based implementation

Interactive command-line interface

Built-in visualization and analysis outputs

Designed for extensibility and experimentation

# How to Use

Download or clone the repository.

Ensure all files remain inside the project folder (do not move individual files).

Open the project folder in MATLAB.

Run main.m.

Follow the interactive prompts to generate and manipulate signals.

# Notes

This repository implements Part II of the project report (Signal Generator & Operator).

Part I contains handwritten analytical solutions and is included in the full project documentation.
